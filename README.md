# BattleShip

This is the project of Ace while following the Odin Project.

Things to know about how the game is implemented:

1. To start the game first you must create your own board.
2. You also can generate a randomize board too.
3. There must be 5 ships.
4. To make a long ship you need to double click the board and hover over the cells you want the ship to take space.
5. The first one to destroy ship wins!

Enjoy!
